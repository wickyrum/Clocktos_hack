# Clocktos_hack
Created a simple pyautogui script to tap and enter all possible 4 digit numbers  (brute force)
instead of looping from 0 to 9999, I used a csv file which is arranged in descending probability of possible 4 digit combinations that drastically reduced the time of the script
(all of the passwords I cracked was done before trying 5% of the combinations which is less than 20 mins for my script)
